## Overview

Photon is an embedded firmware project that transforms a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W into a versatile LED matrix display system with WiFi connectivity. It features a menu-driven interface controlled by physical buttons and a rotary encoder, supporting multiple display modes including stock tickers, weather information, and games.

## Features

### Multiple Display Modes

- **Tickers**: Real-time stock and commodity prices (BTC, Gold, Silver)
- **Games**: Play Tetris directly on the LED matrix
- **Weather**: Current temperature and hourly forecasts for multiple locations

### Custom Graphics Engine

- 32x8 WS2812 LED matrix support
- Custom bitmap font rendering (A-Z, 0-9, punctuation)
- Built-in icon library (weather, games, status indicators)
- RGB color support with brightness control

### WiFi Connectivity

- Fetch live data from external APIs
- Asynchronous connection management
- HTTP request handling

### Interactive Controls

- Two programmable buttons (left/right navigation)
- Rotary encoder with push button
- Real-time input debouncing

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W
- 32x8 WS2812/WS2812B LED matrix
- Rotary encoder (with push button)
- 2x tactile push buttons
- Power supply (5V, depends on LED count)

## Quick Start

1. **[Set up the hardware](getting-started/hardware.md)** - Wire the components
2. **[Flash the firmware](getting-started/flashing.md)** - Upload the `.uf2` file
3. **[Configure WiFi](getting-started/configuration.md)** - Set your credentials
